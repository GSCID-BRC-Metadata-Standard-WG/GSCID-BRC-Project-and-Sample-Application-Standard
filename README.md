The GSCID/BRC Project and Sample Application Standard is designed to capture standardized human pathogen and vector sequencing metadata to support epidemiologic and genotype-phenotype association studies for human infectious diseases. This standard was developed by representatives of the Genome Sequencing Centers for Infectious Diseases (GSCIDs), the Bioinformatics Resource Centers (BRCs), and NIAID and informed by discussions and input with numerous collaborating scientists. The standard includes data fields about the organism(s) in the specimen, environmental source of the specimen, spatial-temporal information about the specimen isolation event, phenotypic characteristics of the pathogen/vector isolated, sequencing and data processing methodologies used, quality and coverage of the resulting sequences, and project leadership and support.

## DMID Clinical Metadata Standards
The intent and scope of the GSCID/BRC Clinical Metadata Standard is to provide an extension to the GSCID/BRC Project and Sample Application Standard that adds data fields related to sequencing studies involving specimens isolated from human participants for which clinical and demographic data would be of interest.
